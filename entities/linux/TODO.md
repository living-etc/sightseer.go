# TODO

## Functionality to implement

- Add charmbracelet log library and make it easy to enable debug mode
- Rewrite the parsing logic to not use regex, instead having each query type
  implement its own parsing logic using Go functions instead of regex

## Research

- Research the scheme for systemctl output. The difference between "preset" and
  "vendor preset" tripped me up - ssh service only had preset, but kubelet had
  "vendor preset".
